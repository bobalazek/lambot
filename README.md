# Lambot

Yes, you read that right. This Bot could possibly catapult you to the moon, so you can start living your lambo lifestyle!

As you can imagine, it's not really that easy as it sounds. Rather than you earning trillions of dollars from your investments, you will far more likely lose it all, so **INVEST ONLY THE MONEY YOU CAN LOSE AND TREAT ANY INVESTMENT AS LOST AS SOON AS YOU INVESTED TO PREVENT ANY SURPRISES**.

## Getting started

First you will need to set up some your config in the `/config/` folder. For now you can just edit the contents of `default.ts` file inside and and set up the parameters (should soon by dynamic). You will also need to copy the contents of `.env.example` to `.env` to setup your exchange credentials. Then you'll need to build it with `yarn build`, and now finally you can run it with `node dist/main.js --session 123`.

## Exchanges

Right now, Binance is the only supported exchange for this trading bot.
