## Commands

* First you need to build the bot: `yarn build`
* Now you can run it: `node dist/main.js`

## Concepts

### Exchange

### Session

A session or a round would basically just be a wrapper for everything we do.

#### Session Asset

A session asset consists of one base asset (the one you want to earn profit in) and asset pairs.
Asset pairs in this case are the assets you want to trade the current asset with.
For example: You have a base asset USDT and you want to trade with USDTBTC, USSDTETH, ...

## TODO

* Jest tests
* Messaging app (like telegram) notifications when buy/sell/trade updates ...
